# IOT-Enabled-TIG-Welding-Machine
Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding is the superior arc welding process used in the manufacturing industry for high quality welds. Skilled welders are capable of monitoring a weld bead and dynamically adjusting the welding parameters (current, voltage, speed, etc.) to produce a desired weld bead quality (width, height, depth). A shortage of skilled workers and motivation for industrial automation has increased research in welding process control and optimization. We propose a Machine Learning algorithm to model the TIG welding process and extract human skill.
